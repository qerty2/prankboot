**Please don't actually use this for malicious purposes. That's gay.**

**This also only works on windows.**

**This is a VERY early framework. The codee is unclear and needs rewriting (which is on the top of my to-do list for this. It does not at all represent what the final version will look like.**

Has a 25% chance to  kill explorer.exe then proceed to open 100 tabs of e621, and will run by itself on startup if you run the installer.

Also has a further 5% chance after that 25% chance to just crash your computer. Fun!

To install this to the startup folder, run installer.py

Otherwise, if you just want to test out the script itself, run main.py :)

I plan to add WAY more funny features in the future, consider this a very early beta
