Funny script that has a 25% chance to run a random function from [here](https://github.com/qerty2/prankboot/blob/main/functions.py) every time you start your computer.
Why would you install this? I don't know. Maybe you install it on your family members computer or something.

Anyway, it only has one dependency besides python and its built-in packages, which can be found [here.](https://github.com/qerty2/prankboot/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS.txt) 

Installer was removed, which im aware was the main point, but it will be added once im ready to release (id like to have the installer install a compiled version for compatibilityâ€™s sake)

If you like this, please don't hesitate to make a pull request and add your own functions / clean up code. I have another script in the same vein as this [here.](https://github.com/qerty2/BSOD-Coin-Flip)
